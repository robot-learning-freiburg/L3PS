# Patchwork++ as an Independent Package in C++

In this directory, we demonstrate how to use `patchworkpp` package using the `find_pakcage` command in `CMakeLists.txt`.

## How to build

In this directory,

```commandline
# mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make -j 16
```

If you want to **run demo**, just run the following command:

```commandline
./demo_visualize
```

Then, you can see the exact same result as Example 1 in the `cpp` directory!
